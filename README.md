# Dotfiles

My dotfiles. It includes my configuration for the following programs :

* LeftWM : tiling window manager config. It includes a config with AZERTY friendly keyboard mapping and some other tweaks, 
it also includes two colorschemes : Gruvbox material and Everforest.
* LunarVim : my config.lua for lunar vim. It's very basic. There's just a colorschemes config and a colorizer plugin config
* tmux : simple tmux config. It just disables every visual elements since I don't want them cluttering my terminal.
* st : my build of the st terminal with colorscheme and alpha patch.
* picom : X compositor config. It handles rounded corners for use with [ibhagwan's picom fork](https://github.com/ibhagwan/picom)
* dunst : notification config.
